# dbtest
A test app for the [simple-db](https://github.com/Shalvah/simple-db) library.

dbtest is a barebones app that displays two possible activities for CRUD operations on teo types of items: `students` or `courses`. Each activity has a ListView listing items currently in the table, and a searchbox and buttons for adding and deleting rows. Addition of attributes is done via comma-separated lists.
